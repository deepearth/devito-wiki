#### Things that we would like to have _in_ Devito

* Code generation for GPUs (hard)
  * The long-term plan is to integrate [OPS](https://github.com/OP-DSL/OPS), just like we did for [YASK](https://github.com/intel/yask) (see `yask` backend in the Devito compiler)
  * However, we are keen to explore other (simpler?) alternatives. For example, OpenMP 4's offloading for GPUs? our own CUDA-based backend? other third-party tools?
  * We also have other issues to deal with. How do we efficiently implement sparse computations such as source injection? 


#### Experimentations that we would like to run -- "is it worth implementing it in the Devito compiler?"
